I'm a first-year doctoral student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) focusing on the control and planning of robot manipulators. My current work explores motion planning, robust control strategies, and closing the gap between theoretical methods and real-world deployment.

Beyond research, I enjoy collaborating on robotics projects that combine perception, planning, and control. I'm always open to discussion about manipulation, dexterous grasping, and software tooling that improves robot reliability.
